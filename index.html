        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am originally from Murray, UT, and I am a Junior in Civil Engineering at BYU.
          My emphasis is in Water Resources and Transportation, and I use python and web
          programming technologies to do data science and develop data visualization tools
          for the Hydroinformatics lab in my department. I am interested in improving my
          programming skills for software and web development, so I can fill a unique niche
          in my field and have the flexibility to work as a strict developer if that allows
          me to better live where I want (my wife and I want to live in Germany for a few
          years at some point).
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to programming and engineering, I am passionate about music. I play
          the cello and the piano, and I also sing in the BYU Men's Chorus. I also love
          the outdoors and my wife and I try to go rock climbing and backpacking as much as
          possible during the summers, though we're not very good climbers so it can be tricky
          to find routes that we can do.

        <h2>Recipe Finder</h2>
        <p>
          I love cooking and often find myself thinking of something I want to eat and just
          making the first recipe blog post that pops up. Sometimes, however, I know what
          ingredients I have and feel like using, but need ideas for what to make with those.
          On top of this, if I find a recipe I really like, it can be tedious to find a place
          to save a link to it, when I'm in a hurry to just cook and eat. In light of this, I
          thought it would be cool to set up some kind of querying service to be able to search
          for recipes in different ways, and an easy way to store and share them seamlessly. The
          code can be found <a href="https://github.com/J-Ogden99/startup">here</a>.
